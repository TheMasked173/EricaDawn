        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <p>
          EricaDawn writes stories where folklore whispers and magic dances through every page.
          In her debut middle-grade fantasy, <em>Mollie’s Ancestral Gift</em>, she writes a love
          letter to heritage. When EricaDawn isn’t conjuring stories, she lives by a shimmering
          lake with her three spirited boys, listening to their melodies float from school band
          performances. She treasures adventures with friends, whether across distant lands or
          in the quiet magic of home.
        </p>
        <p>
          By day, she leads as an executive in a lending company; by heart, she is a dreamer shaped
          by her journeys through Georgetown University and Baylor Law School. Her stories draw
          life from her devotion to her ancestors and the rich history they left as a gift to the
          future. She publishes her stories to inspire her boys and bonus children.
